- 👋 Hi, I’m @eun-chae-s
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science (definitely!), music (especially Kpop), art, psychology, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, Javascript. So far, I have learned only Python and Java. But I am going to learn a few more programming languages for backend soon!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that might bring more convenience!
- 📫 How to reach me: you can either send me an email through the following address (gonna add soon:))
